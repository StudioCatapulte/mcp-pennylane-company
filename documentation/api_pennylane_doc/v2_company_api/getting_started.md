We're excited you're here! 💙

Before you start, please be aware that by using this API, you agree to be bound by our [API contract terms](https://pennylane.readme.io/page/api-contract-terms).

# 🚦 Authentication   [Skip link to 🚦 Authentication](https://pennylane.readme.io/docs/getting-started\#-authentication)

**You are a Pennylane customer**

You can use your own company API Key in order to connect to our API.

**You are a partner**

If you are willing to become an integration partner, you have to use OAuth 2.0 protocol.

You first need to reach out to our partnerships team [here](https://www.pennylane.com/fr/partenaires/partenaire-technologique/) and explain your integration project with us.

# 📈 Create your testing environment   [Skip link to 📈 Create your testing environment](https://pennylane.readme.io/docs/getting-started\#-create-your-testing-environment)

**You are a Pennylane customer**

To test our API without impacting your accounting, we highly recommend you to use a sandbox environment.

Here are the steps to create your sandbox account :

- Connect to your Pennylane account on our platform
- Click on your profile on the top right corner
- Click on "Test environment"
- Click on "Create my sandbox"

You now have access to two different accounts on our platform: your own, and a sandbox account that should be named {Sandbox - <YOUR\_EMAIL>}.

**You are a partner**

Please send a request to [partnerships@pennylane.com](mailto:partnerships@pennylane.com) with your full name & mail address to use for the sandbox creation.

# ✳️ Set-up your testing environment   [Skip link to ✳️ Set-up your testing environment](https://pennylane.readme.io/docs/getting-started\#%EF%B8%8F-set-up-your-testing-environment)

Depending on what areas of the API you're willing to test, you need to set up Pennylane application to make it work.

**For Customer Invoices**

If you've never created an invoice through Pennylane before, or if you're using a new sandbox environment or a new account, chances are your account needs to be set-up. To do so, you need to use the [invoice parameter page in our Pennylane app](https://app.pennylane.tech/companies/first/settings?tab=customer_invoicing).

➡️ Set up your address, contact information (mail), bank account and logo and don't forget to validate.

➡️ Set up the numbering of your invoices. You are required by law to have a sequential numbering of invoices, we will therefore automatically generate the next invoice numbers !

You can also find a [step-by-step guide](https://help.pennylane.com/fr/articles/18863-parametrer-l-editeur-de-factures) (in French) in our Helpcenter.

# 💬 We're here to help!   [Skip link to 💬 We're here to help!](https://pennylane.readme.io/docs/getting-started\#-were-here-to-help)

If you need help throughout your integration process, here is what you can do :

- If you're a customer, reach out to our support team and explain your integration project.
- If you're a partner, reach out to [partnerships@pennylane.com](mailto:partnerships@pennylane.com) or through your already created Zendesk access. Otherwise, Partnerships team will give you access to Zendesk to create tickets & follow-up on them.
